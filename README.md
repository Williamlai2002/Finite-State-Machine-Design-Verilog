# Finite-State-Machine-Design-Verilog
implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) using one-hot encoding to recognize sequences of four consecutive 1s or 0s on the input signal w. The FSM outputs z = 1The FSM transitions through nine states, each represented by a single active flip-flop (y8, ..., y0) as per the one-hot encoding
